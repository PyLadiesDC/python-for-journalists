We'll be working together today with a real data set which contains the cases of **Zika infection in the United States**. We'll learn how to process, analyze and visualize data with Python and Pandas Library. These are the tasks a journalist would have to carry on when she finds an interesting data set and wants to study it to learn what information it contains. But also anybody who is working on any kind of data research will have to go through all these tasks.
